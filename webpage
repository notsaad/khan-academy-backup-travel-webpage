        <p>One of the main reasons any tourists should visit North Korea is because there is a great government and futhermore, has a great leader; Kim Jong-Un. Kim Jong-Un is a great leader and has accomplished many great tasks, here are just a few examples that were published in North Korean media:</p>
        
        <ol>
        <li><strong>He raced a yacht at age nine and sensationally won.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>He is a proficient artist and a world-class music composer.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>He could drive by the time he was three-years-old.</strong></li>
        </ol>

        <p>In North Korea you are able to discover many unique and fascinating traditions. There are many examples of this throughout all part of North Korea however after many lifetimes of research I have come up with an extensive list of attractions in North Korea.
        
         <ul>
        <li><strong>North Korean Military Parade</strong>, In 2018, North Korea had a very unique 70th anniversary military parade featuring large parades and festivals</li>
        <li><strong>Pyongyang Metro</strong>, One of the greatest architectural phenomenons in North Korea is the Pyongyang Metro. Itis a wonderfully built civilian metro and had many mesmerising murals of former North Korean greats.</li>
